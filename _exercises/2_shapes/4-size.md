The canvas is quite small. Use the following statement in the beginning of your sketch to make your canvas bigger:

{% highlight java %}
size(500,500);
{% endhighlight %}

The statement calls size-function, which sets the size for the canvas. Size-function needs two parameters. The first one is the width of the canvas and the second one is the height.
