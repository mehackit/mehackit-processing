Phew! That was an intense section. We covered at least:

<code>noise(x)</code>, <code>noise(x, y)</code>, <code>noise(x, y, z)</code>, <code>map()</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>for</code>.

Open processing and start creating or check the next section. Following the previous examples you could for example modify the mirror drawing sketch to use noise instead of mouse, create colors with noise or map mouse coordinates to create a color for your previous sketches.
