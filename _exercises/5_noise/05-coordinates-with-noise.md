title: Coordinates with noise
---

Below is a full example where a rectangle's coordinates and size are generated with the noise-function. Try to modify the increment values and see how the sketch behaves differently. Following this example, you could also modify the previous section's interactive sketch to generate coordinates with noise instead of mouseX and mouseY.
