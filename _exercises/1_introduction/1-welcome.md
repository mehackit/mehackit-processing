This website contains short examples and exercises to help you getting started with programming. The aim is to explore what kind of visual things you can make with code. We'll be working with a language and environment called <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>, which is widely used by students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists. It's a good choice for for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.

The material is divided into five sections. Each section exhibits a small project and introduces new concepts along the way. After completing a section you can start creating your own project or move to the next section. Each section gives you more inspiration and tools to work with.

The goal is that you create your own work of art and export it to a video. You can first follow the first section to get started and then decide whether to move to the next section or start working on your own project.
