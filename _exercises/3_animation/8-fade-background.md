You can do a lot of cool things with transparent colors. For example, you get a nice fade effect if you use a transparent color instead of a solid background color.

Background function doesn't allow a transparent color as a parameter, but you can draw a canvas-sized rectangle instead. Check the example below and use it in your animation if you wish.
