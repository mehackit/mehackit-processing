## Exercise - an animation with Processing

You now have a rich set of tools for fulfilling you creative goals with Processing. Translations, loops and writing your own methods allows you to create repetition and complex interaction.  

You can return to the composition you made in the first chapter. Try to write your own method that draws a similar composition. After that you can experiment with repetition and easily draw hundreds of patterns in the same sketch! While your at it you can animate you sketch with rotation for example.

Next section lists few other resources that might give you inspiration.
